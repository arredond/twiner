# `MUR-STRUB_LWAL-DNO` (unreinforced rubble-stone masonry, no ductility)
# added per docs/validation-lorca-2011.md §10.1/§10.4 for pre-1940
# vernacular construction. `MUR_LWAL-DNO` (generic unreinforced masonry)
# replaced `MR_LWAL-DUL` per ADR-0032: in the GEM taxonomy `MR` is
# *reinforced* masonry -- which is why §10.1 found it the least vulnerable
# masonry class here -- while 1940-1969 Spanish masonry is unreinforced.
# Only H1-H5 exist upstream for the two masonry classes (vs. H1-H12 for
# concrete) -- `_file_names` requesting H6-H12 for them 404s and is
# skipped, same handling `fetch_fragility_functions` already has for any
# (class, height) combination that doesn't exist.
