"""Heuristic mapping: Catastro attributes -> GEM-taxonomy-ish vulnerability class.

**This is the least-validated part of the MVP.** No field survey backs it
(per the project's no-fieldwork constraint) -- it's a documented, versioned
guess, not an observation, and every building carries that provenance
(`taxonomy_source`, TAXONOMY_SOURCE below) rather than silently looking as
authoritative as a surveyed value would.

The heuristic: Spain's shift from unreinforced/confined masonry to
reinforced-concrete-frame construction happened predominantly from the
1960s-70s onward (matching the introduction of modern seismic-resistant
design codes, and the general pattern described for Lorca's own building
stock in docs/merisur.md §4.5 -- 1 RC class vs. 5 masonry classes there,
consistent with masonry dominating the pre-modern stock).

Originally a single year threshold (concrete vs. one generic masonry
class) -- refined to a second threshold per
docs/validation-lorca-2011.md §10.1/§10.4: the generic masonry class alone
turned out to be the *least* vulnerable option available for exactly the
pre-modern, vernacular-construction era it was meant to cover, materially
understating damage for Lorca's old town. Still coarser than the fuller
code-generation timeline sketched in docs/initial-chatgpt.md -- a further
refinement, not the last one, once there's reason to believe *that* changes
results materially in turn.

Output classes match exactly what pipelines/fragility vendors from Martins
& Silva (2020): `CR_LDUAL-DUL` (reinforced concrete, dual lateral system,
low ductility) for newer construction; `MUR_LWAL-DNO` (unreinforced
masonry, load-bearing wall, non-ductile, unit material unspecified) for
masonry-era construction with no further information; `MUR-STRUB_LWAL-DNO` (unreinforced rubble-stone masonry, no
ductility) for construction old enough to plausibly predate even confined/
reinforced masonry practice. "Low ductility"/"no ductility" are
conservative defaults throughout, since Catastro gives us no seismic design
information to distinguish ductility classes.
