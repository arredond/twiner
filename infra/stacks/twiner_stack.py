"""The milestone-1 stack: static data storage + the scenario Lambda.

Deliberately minimal (docs/milestone-1-plan.md §8 "explicitly out of
scope"): one data bucket for pipeline outputs (buildings.parquet,
exposure.parquet, fragility.parquet, buildings.pmtiles), one results bucket
for scenario outputs, one Lambda (packaged as a container image -- the
scenario package pulls in openquake.hazardlib/numpy/scipy, comfortably over
the zip-based Lambda size limit), exposed via a Function URL (no API
Gateway -- nothing here needs its extra features yet).
