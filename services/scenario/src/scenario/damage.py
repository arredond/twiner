    `im_values_by_type`: `{im_type_label: array}`, one entry per intensity

    [g]": ...}`), each array aligned with `taxonomy_classes`/`height_classes`

    type -- *not* one value per group). Each (taxonomy, height) group looks
    up its own curve's `im_type` (`FragilityCurve.im_type`) and reads its IM
    values from the matching array -- this is the fix for
    docs/validation-lorca-2011.md §10.2: previously every building was
    evaluated against a single SA(0.3s) array regardless of which IM type
    its own curve was actually indexed by.

    `damage_percentile`: see `select_damage_state` -- `None` (default)
    picks each building's modal state (argmax); a float in (0, 1] picks the
    smallest state whose cumulative probability reaches it, vectorized as
    "first row where the running cumulative sum crosses the threshold"
    (`np.argmax` on a boolean array returns its first True, and the last
    row's cumulative sum is always ~1.0 by construction, so one is always
    found -- same guarantee `percentile_damage_state`'s scalar fallback
    documents).

    prob_extensive, prob_complete. `im_value`/`im_type` record which IM
