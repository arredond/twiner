"""Content-addressed scenario ids, and the switch for reusing them as a cache.

A scenario_id is a hash of everything that determines a scenario's result:

- the request's own inputs (fault_id + probability_level for automatic
  mode, plus near_lat/near_lon only when that fault actually uses them --
  faults.py's `rupture_anchor`; every manual-mode field for manual mode),
- `API_VERSION`: the calculation code's version. **Bump it whenever a
  change to rupture/ground-motion/damage/response logic could change any
  result or the response shape** -- that's what invalidates every cached
  result computed by older code. CalVer, logged in CHANGELOG-API.md.
- `data_version()`: which pipeline outputs were read (`TWINER_DATA_VERSION`,
  set per deployment -- infra/stacks/twiner_stack.py). **Bump it whenever
  exposure/fragility/faults/buildings data is re-uploaded.** CalVer,
  logged in CHANGELOG-DATA.md.

Identical requests land on the same id, which means the results already
stored under it (results_store.py locally, the results bucket in the cloud)
can be served instead of recomputing -- when `cache_enabled()`. The id is
always content-addressed, cache or not; the flag only decides whether an
existing entry is trusted. See docs/decisions/0018-scenario-result-cache.md.
