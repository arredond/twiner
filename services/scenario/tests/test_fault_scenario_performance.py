"""Real-scale performance integration test for /scenarios/fault and
/scenarios/manual, against the full national dataset if present locally.

test_local_api.py's own timing assertions run against a synthetic 3-building
fixture -- fast by construction regardless of whether a real performance
regression exists, since they never touch the (evaluated buildings x fault
mesh points) cost that actually dominates a real request (ADR-0009). This
module exercises that real cost directly: a long, nationwide-reach fault
(QAFI's Peñacova-Régua-Verín/PO011 and Manteigas-Vilariça-Bragança/PO007,
both flagged in ADR-0009/ADR-0014 as the faults that previously regressed
to a multi-minute hang and a 10-20s-per-request join respectively) run at
real scale, with a ceiling generous enough to absorb CI/laptop variance but
tight enough to catch a real regression back into that territory.

Skipped wherever the national dataset (`data/exposure`) hasn't been
crawled locally -- same "local sanity check, not a CI requirement" pattern
as test_engine_integration.py's own smaller/faster version.
