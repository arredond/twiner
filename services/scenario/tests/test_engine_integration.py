"""Integration test against real pipeline outputs, if present locally.

Skipped in CI/fresh checkouts where nobody has run the exposure/fragility
pipelines yet -- this is a local sanity check, not a substitute for the
unit tests in test_damage.py / test_ground_motion.py, which don't need any
data files. See test_fault_scenario_performance.py for the heavier,
real-scale/timing version of this same idea.
